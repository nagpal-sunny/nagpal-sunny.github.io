The section in a list can serve as the main cell and the cell can serve as the expended cell. Unlike UIKit, SwiftUI List View adjusts automatically based on the data source. No need to reload or delete cells just provide the expected format data and it will... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Simplify Template Pattern (Behaviour Pattern)</title><link href="http://codeworld.blog/posts/design%20pattern/clean%20code/templatepattern/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simplify Template Pattern (Behaviour Pattern)" /><published>2023-09-20T20:00:10+05:30</published> <updated>2023-10-07T14:22:00+05:30</updated> <id>http://codeworld.blog/posts/design%20pattern/clean%20code/templatepattern/</id> <content src="http://codeworld.blog/posts/design%20pattern/clean%20code/templatepattern/" /> <author> <name>saurav_nagpal</name> </author> <category term="Design Pattern" /> <category term="Clean Code" /> <summary> üåë Outline The Template pattern defines steps for an algorithm in a superclass and a subclass can override specific steps to provide desired behaviour without changing the execution flow of the algorithm. The function that decides the execution sequence of an algorithm is called the Template method.

Playing games on paper while the teacher is present in the classroom is what everyone remembers. This was one of the games I played most of the time with friends. The game is simple yet engaging. You have to connect all the balls (dots on the paper) with a line. The line can be drawn with the use of a joystick.

Effective Memory Management in an application is crucial for better performance of the application. iOS applications developed using Swift language rely on ARC for tracking and managing application memory usage. ARC uses reference counting to manage the application memory. What is ARC? ARC is a memory management too... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Distribute iOS Beta Build (Scheme &amp; Configurations)</title><link href="http://codeworld.blog/posts/ios/ios%20beta%20build/iOS-Custom-Build-Scheme/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Distribute iOS Beta Build (Scheme &amp;amp; Configurations)" /><published>2023-07-02T17:01:10+05:30</published> <updated>2023-09-29T21:37:37+05:30</updated> <id>http://codeworld.blog/posts/ios/ios%20beta%20build/iOS-Custom-Build-Scheme/</id> <content src="http://codeworld.blog/posts/ios/ios%20beta%20build/iOS-Custom-Build-Scheme/" /> <author> <name>Saurav Nagpal</name> </author> <category term="iOS" /> <category term="iOS Beta Build" /> <summary> üåë Outline Having multiple build configurations during the application‚Äôs development phase is a good practice. Customers can ask for both debug and release configuration builds. Beta and Alpha testing is an important phase of the application life cycle. Beta and Alpha builds might have different configurations from the release build. This blog explains one of the ways to handle this through an ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
